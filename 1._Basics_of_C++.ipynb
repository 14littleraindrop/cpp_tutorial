    "C++ uses a convenient abstraction called streams to perform input and output operations in sequential media such as the screen, the keyboard or a file. A stream is an entity where a program can either insert or extract characters to/from, it's a source/destination of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard library defines a handful of stream objects that can be used to access what are considered the standard sources and destinations of characters by the environment where the program runs:\n",

    "## - Standard output (cout) ##\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the standard output is the screen. To make an output appears on your screen, C++ uses `cout` together with the *insertion operator* `<<`.\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "cout << \"Hello\";    // print Hello\n",
    "cout << Hello;      // print the content of variable Hello\n",
    "```\n",
    "You could also chain a series of `<<` together, which is especially useful to mix literals and variables in a single statement:\n",
    "```cpp \n",
    "cout << \"I am \" << age << \"years old.\"; \n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that `cout` does not automatically add line breaks at the end. To do so, add a new-line character `\\n` at the end. \n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "cout << \"First sentance.\\n\";          // do this to change line\n",
    "cout << \"Second sentance.\" << '\\n';   // or this\n",
    "```\n",
    "Alternatively, `endl` can also be used to break lines, which produces a newline character, exactly as the insertion of `\\n` does:\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "cout << \"First sentance.\" << endl;\n",
    "cout << \"Second sentence.\" << endl;\n",
    "```\n",
    "`endl` has an additional behanior compare to `\\n`, not just breaking the line, it also flushes the streams's buffer, which means that the output is requested to be physically written to the device, if it wasn't already.\n",

    "```cpp\n",
    "int age;\n",
    "cin >> age;\n",
    "```\n",
    "When `cin` is appears, the program will wait for an input from `cin`, generally this means waiting for the user to type in the input. When the user presses `ENTER`, the value entered is stored in variable `age` and the program continuies. Note that the extraction operation on `cin` uses the type of the variable after the `>>` operator to determine how it interprets the characters read from the input.\n",

    "The extraction operator can be used on cin to get strings of characters in the same way as with fundamental data types. However, be aware that `cin` extraction always considers spaces (whitespaces, tabs, new-line...) as terminating the value being extracted, hence, you cannot extract a full sentance for example. To get an entire line from `cin`, there exists a function, called `getline`, which takes the stream (`cin`) as the first argument and the string variables as second.\n",
